# Simple Vite.js React App

Welcome to your new Vite.js React app, which is ready to be deployed on GitHub Pages! This README will guide you through using this repository and deploying your web application so you can share it with the world.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): This is necessary to run the project and includes npm (Node Package Manager) which we'll use to manage the project's dependencies.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): Version control system to manage the source code of your application.

## Getting Started

First, clone this repository to get a local copy on your computer. Open your terminal, and run:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Very-Good-Apps-LLC/verygoodapps.co.git
cd verygoodapps.co
```

Then, install the dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

This command fetches all the necessary packages required to run and build your React application.

## Running Locally

To start the development server and view your application in the browser, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts a local development server provided by Vite.js and opens up your browser to `http://localhost:5173` where your app is running. The server provides hot reloading, so changes you make in the code will automatically refresh the page.

## Structure of the Repository

- `src/`: This directory contains all your React components and your main application logic.
- `index.html`: The entry point for your web application.
- `vite.config.js`: Configuration file for Vite.js, which includes settings for the development and production builds.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

To deploy your app to GitHub Pages, you'll use the `gh-pages` plugin, which automates the process of publishing the files generated during the build to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository.

Deploy the build to GitHub Pages:

   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

   This command runs a script that the `gh-pages` plugin uses to push the contents of the `dist/` directory to the `gh-pages` branch of your GitHub repository.

After running the deploy command, your application will be available at `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/`.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

As you work with your Vite.js React application, you might encounter some issues, especially when it comes to deployment. Here are a few common problems and how to resolve them:

### 1. **Page Not Found on GitHub Pages**

**Problem:** After deploying, you see a "404 Page Not Found" error when you visit your GitHub Pages URL.

**Solution:** This usually happens if the `base` configuration in `vite.config.js` is not set correctly. Ensure that it matches the repository name with a leading slash and trailing slash. For example:

```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/your-repo-name/',
  plugins: [react()]
})
```

### 2. **Changes Not Reflecting After Deployment**

**Problem:** You've deployed your application, but the changes are not visible on GitHub Pages.

**Solution:** This might be due to browser caching or a delay in GitHub Pages updating. First, try clearing your browser's cache and reloading the page. If that doesnâ€™t work, ensure that the `gh-pages` branch in your repository contains the latest build.

### 3. **Build or Deployment Fails**

**Problem:** The `npm run deploy` command fails with an error message in the terminal.

**Solution:** Check the error message provided in the terminal for clues. Common issues include:

- **Dependency issues:** Run `npm install` to make sure all dependencies are correctly installed.
- **Configuration errors:** Verify that there are no syntax errors in `vite.config.js`.
